-Help me build a full end-to-end web application that allows users to upload files and perform various file conversions. 

-Specifically, I want the website to support converting images from PNG to JPEG , JPEG to PNG, webp to png ,jfif to png, png to svg, heic to jpg , heic to png and also there should be a section name image convertor and when the user uploads a file there it shows all the options to convert from the image format provided to any other ( you can refer to website freeconvert.com/image-convertor ) 

It should also have a resizing section and cropping section -
  resize section should png resizers , jpg resizer , bulk resizer, webp resizers 
  crop section  should png crop , jpg crop ,webp crop, crop ( for all file formats)

Please generate the frontend and backend code needed for this functionality, and use a user-friendly interface where users can upload files, choose their conversion options, and then download the converted results. Use standard web technologies and any libraries you find appropriate.

the color theme for the website should be -- #778873 , --#A1BC98 , -- #D2DCB6, -- #F1F3E0

also include to section teaching users how to convert their images
